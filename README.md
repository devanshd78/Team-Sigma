Team Name : Sigma
Details : Devansh Dubey, Tushar Shishodia, Deepanshu Ahuja ( Sharda University )

Idea & Approach : Driver Drowsiness Detection project aims to detect when a driver is feeling drowsy by monitoring their eye movements. When drowsiness is detected, the system alerts the driver with a sound. If the driver does not respond, the system automatically stops the vehicle by slowing it down & sends their location to their relatives. Additionally, the system will send an alert to their relatives if the vehicle is involved in a crash. This project aims to improve road safety and prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue.
